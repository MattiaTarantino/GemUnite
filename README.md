#  Project Overview
GemUnite is an application that allows IT enthusiasts to search for or create small to medium-sized groups to work on projects within their areas of interest.

Upon creating an account, the user, in addition to personal information, enters their areas of interest, such as machine learning, web development, cybersecurity, IoT, etc. On the homepage, the user will see some project proposals in their areas of interest. For each proposal, they can view the current members, get information about the project's creator, and access details about the proposed project, with the option to send a request to join the group.

A registered user can create a project proposal by providing information about the field, a description of the project idea, and the group's size. Once published, they can accept or reject participation requests.

In the projects section, users can view the projects they are participating in, along with relevant information. By accessing each project's page, a member can track progress through checkpoints set by the leader, add internal tasks to a checkpoint, and mark tasks as completed. A user can also edit project information and remove members from groups they've created. Project members can use a chat and access the project's repository created through the Github API.
